React.js Slide Puzzle
====================

A 3X3 slide puzzle written in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). Check out the [live example](http://henleyedition.com/reactjs-slide-puzzle/).

I was inspired to write this after running through Brian Barnett's great [Tic Tac React tutorial](http://w.brianbar.net/2014/08/tic-tac-react-part-1/), and therefore mine shares much of the same code. I'd really recommend it if you're interested in learning about React.
