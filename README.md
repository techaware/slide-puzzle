Hill climbing Algorithm applied to Slide Puzzle
====================

Check out the [live example](http://ecotaru.com/slide-puzzle-eval/) to see how Hill Climbing Algorithm depth influences optimization of the puzzle solution.

Slide puzzle UI is based on Evan Henley's [project](http://henleyedition.com/reactjs-slide-puzzle/) which is inspired from [Tic Tac React tutorial](http://w.brianbar.net/2014/08/tic-tac-react-part-1/).
